## Overview

`render_cdk` provides a streamlined interface for interacting with Render, a platform that allows you to build, deploy, and scale your apps with ease. This crate _abstracts_ Render's API, making it easier to work with Render cloud _**programmatically**_.

### Current Features

Work on the resource management module is currently under way. The API supports many of the same actions available from the Render Dashboard. It currently provides endpoints for managing:

The CDK will provide an abstraction that will make it easier to work with the Render cloud programmatically.
